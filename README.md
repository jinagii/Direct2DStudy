# Direct2D_Study

In order to study about "Direct 2D", I uploaded a project and its D2D engine. (embarrassed to call it 'engine')

- Project : WinMain (which is demo for D2D Engine)
- PrjEngine : a group of functions that can draw rectangle, circle and can choose brushes.

1. Initialization of D2D in WinAPI.
2. I have studied a transform about translation, rotation and scaling.
3. Collision check is added by highlighting edge colors of rectangles and circles.
4. I have studied about AABB(Axis Aligned Bounding Box) and Circle collision on 3. section.
5. I have tried make functions about vectors and matrices.
6. PNG sprite is loaded on the window.
