# Direct2D_Study

In order to study about "Direct 2D", I uploaded a project and its D2D engine. (embarrassed to call it 'engine')

1. Initialization of D2D in WinAPI.
2. I have studied a transform about translation, rotation and scaling.
3. Collision check is added by highlighting edge colors of rectangles and circles.
4. PNG sprite is loaded on the window.
