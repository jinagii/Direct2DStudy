# Direct2D_Study

In order to study about "Direct 2D", I uploaded a project and its D2D engine. (embarrassed to call it 'engine')

1. Initialization of D2D in WinAPI.
2. Basically, the Project is WinMain and the PrjEngine is a group of functions that can draw rectangle, circle and can choose brushes.
3. I have studied a transform about translation, rotation and scaling.
4. Collision check is added by highlighting edge colors of rectangles and circles.
5. I have studied about AABB(Axis Aligned Bounding Box) and Circle collision on 3. section.
6. I have tried make functions about vectors and matrices.
7. PNG sprite is loaded on the window.
